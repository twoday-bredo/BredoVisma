# Projects

The system is build with a .NET backend and SQL stored procedures to handle business logic, with a AngularJS single-page application frontend.

## Moodagent A/S Music Streaming
__Period__: Nov 2020 - Feb 2022

__Role__: Software Engineer

__Project__: Moodagent App

__Description__:

Moodagent was a Danish music streaming app - a direct competitor to Spotify. The app used analysis of a song's musical features to determine similarity to other songs. This is how the app primarily recommended new music to the user, in contrast to other music streaming services, which recommend the music that other similar users are listening to. The business idea was to increase the amount of artists being listened to and therefore spread the pay to more artists. In my role as Software Engineer for Moodagent I developed, deployed and maintained REST APIs for the user-related data in the app, such as social posts, playlists and other. The APIs were written with .NET 3.1, containerized using Docker, and deployed as Microservices into a Kubernetes cluster using automated CICD pipelines. The whole lifecycle of the APIs was handled by me and my other API colleague on the team. We had the responsibility of 6 APIs, each handling their own business area.

__Technnologies used__:
* .Net API backend
* MongoDB Database
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Kubernetes
* Docker
* Kafka
* Terraform
* Git

## vCatch Automatic test system
__Costumer__: Visma consulting A/S

__Period__: Aug 2020 - Oct 2020

__Role__: Automated Tester

__Project__: vCatch

__Description__:

Visma Fishery Solutions is a team within Visma who provides solutions to the Fishery industry. vCatch is one of their products, which is an integrated application for electronic logging of fishery activities and locations of boats. It is used by many countries in the world to make sure the fishing quotas are upheld. 
vCatch needed their automated test system to get a facelift, as manually checking the entire user interface for any new introduced bugs on each release would take too many resources. I created automated tests for the system using Selenium, which controls an actual browser with the application running. I deployed the tests on a Windows server with a sceduler to continously run the tests on the testing environment.

__Technologies used__:
* Java
* Selenium
* Windows Server
* Bash scripting

## Property Assessment System (UFST)

__Costumer__:  Udviklings- og Forenklingsstyrelsen (UFST) – Implementeringscenter for Ejendomsvurdering (ICE)

__Period__: Sep 2018 - May 2020

__Role__: Developer and Tech Lead

__Project__: The new Property Assessment System

__Description__:

Since about 2011 the property assessments of all properties in Denmark was put on hold, as the former system was deemed illegal. This project is to create a new system that upholds all laws and are able to decrease the amount of manual case work needed to assess all properties in denmark. The system consists of many moving parts, including but not limited to: A case worker front end, a user-facing front end, a geographic information system, case lifecycle state machine, and personalised letter generation.
The whole project consisted of about 300 developers, business analysts, architects, testers, Product Owners, Scrum masters, project managers and more. We worked using the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), consisting of Program increments, sprints, PI Planning, etc.

As a developer I cocreated templates and a socalled merge-engine to merge the data and corresponding business rules into a HTML format of a personalized letter for each citizen with their property assessment and all related information. This was done using HTML, Clojure, Clojurescript, AWS Lambda and more. 
Further into the project I was appointed Tech Lead for team handling the orchistration of citizen letters. My responsibility included the deliveries of 4 developers and inmfrastructural deployment of the system, which orchistrated the generation, journaling, and publishing of personalized letters for citizens.

__Technologies used__:
* Clojure
* AWS Lamda
* AWS SQS
* AWS S3
* SQL
* Docker
* Terraform
* Git
